# Vehicle-Dynamics
Ongoing numerical simulation vehicle dynamics project developed for the UVM Alternative Energy Racing Organization.

An iterative numerical solver will calculate a variety of vehicle parameters as a 2-Dimensional vehicle proceeds along a 'course.' Courses are defined by .kml routes exported by Google Maps.

Primary goals of the project are to predict dynamic vehicle performance parameters such as peak acceleration, power requirements, well-to-wheels efficiencies, etc.
